## Welcome to the election compass for the representative council elections 2025

This year, representative council elections will be held in every student union
of Finnish universities. The Representative Council is the highest
decision-making body of a student union. For example, it decides on the student
union’s finances and elects the student union’s board. You can find out more
about your student union’s elections from your student unions website.

The election compasses are provided by
[National Union of University Students in Finland (SYL)](https://syl.fi/en/).

You can find the elections compasses here when they are published.
